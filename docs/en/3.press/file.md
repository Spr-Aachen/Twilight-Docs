title: Single-File Workflow

One of the two ways to author posts in the Twilight blog system. This approach is ideal for simple posts that do not require managing many images or assets.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Using the single-file workflow prevents RSS from resolving local image paths correctly. If your posts rely on RSS with local media, choose the folder-based workflow instead. (Remote image hosts are fine.)

## Create a Post

1. Inside `src/content/posts`, create a new Markdown file with a descriptive name, for example `my-first-post.md`.
2. Add frontmatter‚Äîthe metadata block at the top of the file. At minimum, include `title` and `description`:

```markdown
---
title: Markdown Tutorial
published: 2025-01-20
pinned: true
description: A simple example of a Markdown blog post.
tags: [Markdown, Blogging]
category: Examples
licenseName: "Unlicensed"
author: emn178
sourceLink: "https://github.com/emn178/markdown"
draft: false
date: 2025-01-20
image:
  url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg'
  alt: 'Cover image description'
pubDate: 2025-01-20
---
```

3. Write the article content beneath the frontmatter using standard Markdown syntax.

## Frontmatter Field Reference

Supported fields include:

### Required
- `title`: Post title.
- `description`: Short summary used in listings and SEO.

### Publishing
- `published`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- `pubDate`: Publication date used by feeds (mirrors `published`).
- `date`: Created timestamp.
- `draft`: Set to `true` to hide the post in production.

### Taxonomy & Positioning
- `tags`: Array of tags describing the topic.
- `category`: Broad classification for the post.
- `pinned`: When `true`, pin the article to the top of lists.

### Author & Licensing
- `author`: Display name of the author.
- `licenseName`: License identifier, e.g. `MIT`, `CC BY 4.0`.
- `sourceLink`: Link to the original source or repository.

### Images
- `image`: Cover image configuration. (Remember RSS cannot resolve local paths in single-file mode.)
  - `url`: Image URL.
  - `alt`: Alternative text.

## Frontmatter Best Practices

### Date Formats
Use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD):

```yaml
published: 2025-01-20
date: 2025-01-20
pubDate: 2025-01-20
```

### Tags & Categories
- Choose specific, relevant tags.
- Use categories for broader organization.

Example:

```yaml
tags: [Vue.js, JavaScript, Frontend, Tutorial]
category: Web Development
```

### Draft Management
- `draft: true` hides the post in production builds.
- `draft: false` publishes it normally.

### License Suggestions
Common values include:
- `MIT`
- `Apache-2.0`
- `CC BY 4.0`
- `CC BY-SA 4.0`
- `Unlicensed`

## Previewing Posts

After saving the file, preview it in the browser. Append the filename (without `.md`) to your dev URL.

Example: if your dev server runs at `http://localhost:4321/` and the file is `my-first-post.md`, open `http://localhost:4321/posts/my-first-post`.

If the post does not exist or the path is incorrect, you will see a 404. Console output can help diagnose missing content.

## Linking to Posts

Use standard HTML anchors to link to posts:

```html
<a href="/posts/my-first-post/">My first post</a>
```

Ensure the `href` points to the correct slug.

## Adding Images

Place images inside the `public` directory and reference them with absolute paths:

```markdown
![Cover description](/images/my-image.png)
```

## Creating Multiple Posts

You can keep multiple Markdown files in `src/content/posts/`:

```
src/content/posts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-post.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-second-post.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-third-post.md
```

Each file corresponds to a unique post, and the filename becomes the URL path.

## Linking Multiple Posts

Create an index list elsewhere on your site:

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="/posts/my-first-post/">My first post</a></li>
  <li><a href="/posts/my-second-post/">My second post</a></li>
  <li><a href="/posts/my-third-post/">My third post</a></li>
</ul>
```

Maintain accurate `href` values for each article.

## Notes

- Filenames become URL slugs; keep them descriptive and avoid special characters.
- The `date` field is optional‚Äîmissing values fall back to the file creation time.
- Single-file mode is suited to lightweight posts. For media-heavy articles, switch to the folder workflow to keep assets organized and RSS-friendly.
